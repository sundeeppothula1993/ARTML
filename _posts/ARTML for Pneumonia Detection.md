## Problem:

Pneumonia is a form of a respiratory infection that affects the lungs and it is the single largest infectious cause of death in children worldwide. According to the World health organization, Pneumonia killed 920136 children under the age of 5 in 2015 alone, accounting for 16% of all deaths of children under five years old. When an individual has pneumonia, the parts of the lungs are filled with pus and fluid, which makes breathing painful and limits oxygen intake.
