In the Big Data world Exploring data is a prerequisite to analyzing data. Without proper exploration we could potentially use the wrong data and lead to non-optimal conclusions. Since the scope of datasets is very large, data exploration also brings important aspects of the data into focus for further analysis. 

Real time Data Exploration can be catogarized into two types:

	1. Real time Univariate Data Exploration
	2. Real time Bivariate Data Exploration

### Real time Univariate Data Exploration:

Univariate analysis explores variables (attributes) one by one by summarizing each attribute using statistical techniques.
