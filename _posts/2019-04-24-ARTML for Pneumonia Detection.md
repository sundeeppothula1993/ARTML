## Problem:

Pneumonia is a form of a respiratory infection that affects the lungs and it is the single largest infectious cause of death in children worldwide. According to the World health organization, Pneumonia killed 920136 children under the age of 5 in 2015 alone, accounting for 16% of all deaths of children under five years old. When an individual has pneumonia, the parts of the lungs are filled with pus and fluid, which makes breathing painful and limits oxygen intake.


Detecting infection in early stages is crucial for curing pneumonia. Chest X-rays are currently the best available method for detecting this. However, using chest X-rays is a challenging task since it requires expert radiologists for making the decision.Also, statistics show that Pneumonia is most prevalent in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa where there are only a few experts to classify chest X-ray for abnormalities. Hence there is a lot of research in this area for building models that can automatically detect pneumonia from chest X-rays. State of the art models like CheXNet developed by Stanford ML group is making detections at a level exceeding practicing radiologists. One significant problem with the current solution is that it doesnâ€™t leverage the vast amount of labeled data which is generated every day. Using this data could make models more robust and effective for pneumonia detection. Current work explores ARTML methodology for building models that are scalable and giving the power of continual learning.
